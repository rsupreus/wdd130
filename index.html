        <p>My name is RoseDana Supreus and I was born in Haiti, but have lived in the states since I
            was 5 years old. I've lived in Florida,Texas, Nevada, and now Utah. I do miss the
            beaches in Florida, but I am a mountain girl at heart so I've been slowly making my way
            west. I have 5 siblings and I am the middle child in two ways. I am the third born and I
            am the second of 3 girls. I am a convert to the church as of July 2024 and this has been
            both the best and hardest year of my life. I've worked in software before but had no
            formal degrees or certificates so I am looking forward to growing in skillset and
            knowledge. Outside of
            school, I love being outdoors. I enjoy hiking and finding new trails. I also enjoy
            sports. I play pickleball and
            volleyball, but I love watching football, hockey, and baseball.
            I also love serving. Since I became a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-ay
            Saints,
            I've learned a lot about serving others. When we serve others, we serve God. We are
            called as Christians
            to love others as God loves us. I can't think of another to show examples of His than by
            serving my fellow
            brothers and sisters.

        <p>Utah, otherwise knwon as the Beehive state, is known for it's outdoor recreation and
            beautiful natural landscapes. It's home to multiple national parks, the Great Salt Lake,
            and Bonneville Salt Flats.
            It's also rich in culture and history and it holds the Sundance Film Festival, dinosaur
