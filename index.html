        <p>My name is RoseDana Supreus and I was born in Haiti, but have lived in the states since I
            was 5 years old. I've lived in Florida,Texas, Nevada, and now Utah. I do miss the
            beaches in Florida, but I am a mountain girl at heart so I've been slowly making my way
            west. I have 5 siblings and I am the middle child in two ways. I am the third born and I
            am the second of 3 girls. I am a convert to the church as of July 2024 and this has been
            both the best and hardest year of my life. I've worked in software before but had no
            formal degrees or
            certificates so I am looking forward to growing in skillset and knowledge. Outside of
            school, I love being outdoors.
            I enjoy hiking and finding new trails. I also enjoy sports. I play pickleball and
            volleyball, but I love watching football, hockey, and baseball.
