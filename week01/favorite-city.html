    <h1>Favorite City</h1>
    <p>My current favorite city is St. George, Utah. I have lived here since November of 2025 and it
        has easily become my favorite place to be.
        I enjoy all the city has to offer for those who love the outdoors. Adding new trails and
        mountains to my completed list is how I relax. St. George is a beautiful city and I highly
        recommend visiting!
